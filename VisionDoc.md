## Section 5: Product Features
### 5.1 - Graphs & Charts at a glance: Our product will feature quite a few graphs and charts so that NICU nurses and staff may view information about the current status of neonatal patients at a glance. We may expand this to be customizable, so that different staff may choose different preferences on which information they would like to view
### 5.2 - Data Entry Form: Our product will feature a separate webpage so that staff may enter data in to the program to be viewed. The information gathered may vary depending on what kind of data is being entered. 
### 5.3 - Auto Updating: The dashboard will automatically update whenever new data is entered. Of course, since our product is a web application, you may always use the refresh button in your browser to refresh as well

## Section 6: Exemplary use cases
Our product is designed to be used as an 'at a glance' overview of the neonatal unit at the HSC. The graphs and charts page is designed to be a sort of static display on monitors around the office, with data entry being done perhaps by a secretary for instance on another machine. Once data is entered, all monitors displaying our web app should automatically update.
